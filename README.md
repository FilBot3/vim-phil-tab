# vim-phil-tab

## Overview 

A simple Vimscript Plugin to switch to different tabs by using colon commands

## Installation

Clone the repository to your operating system's Vim folder

* Linux/MacOS
  * `$HOME/.vim/pack/<name>/start/vim-phil-tab`
* Windows
  * `%HOME%\vimfiles\pack\<name>\start\vim-phil-tab`

Make sure to replace `<name>` with a name of a Plugin's Package. This is from Vim's own package manager.

Restart Vim, or `:source $MYVIMRC` to load the plugins. More information can be found here at [Vim Casts #69](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/packages/).

## Contributing

I don't expect anyone to really contribute as this was just a small plugin, but make a fork, create a feature branch, then commit your changes. Then open a pull request with those changes when ready.
